1) Personal preference Would be to Nest most API data one layer further to provide more options in the future

2) RE: add_schedule endpoint, add optional schedule_id field so that client and specify an id

3) Current get_schedules call seems to return invalid device despite accepting create schedule call

4) 33355533355533 isn't valid (api responds with invalid regex, as less than 15 characters)

1) RE: add_schedule endpoint, add optional schedule_id field so that client and specify an id

2) Current get_schedules call seems to return invalid device despite accepting create schedule call

3) 33355533355533 isn't valid (api responds with invalid regex, as less than 15 characters)

4) (Not Critical) Personal preference Would be to Nest most API data one layer further to provide more options in the future
